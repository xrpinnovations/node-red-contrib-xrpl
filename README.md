Check out the <a href="https://flows.nodered.org/" target="_blank">extensive library of flows and nodes</a> shared by the community, you can get some real inspiration and create some awesome things.

Example flows will be added to this repo on a regular basis, in the meantime you can check out our <a href="quick_examples.md">quick examples here.</a> Share your flows and lets build something great together. Feel free to submit PRs.

#### Regular Payments Example
<img src="images/regular_payments.png"/>

Tutorials will be added to the <a href="https://xrpi.io" target="_blank">blog on our site</a> once we're ready so stay tuned.

These nodes are still fresh off the keyboard and although a lot of time and effort has gone into testing there is still more testing assurance work to be done. Please test your flows on the testnet before using real zerps and allows be sensible in how you approach this.

#### Installation Instructions  
Node-Red can be <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">installed on pretty much anything</a>, from Raspberry Pis to Android Phones/Tablets, Windows PCs, Linux all the way up to cloud enterprise solutions.

Once you're up and running with Node-Red (see above link) then <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/adding-nodes" target="_blank">it's simple to add these set of XRP nodes.</a>

To do this select Manage Palette from the menu (top right), and then select the install tab in the palette. Search for node-red-contrib-XRPL and click install.

After successful installation you will see the XRPL & XRPL Advanced sections added to your node palette.

Now you can begin to interact with the XRPL by dragging and dropping these nodes onto your workspace and wiring them together!
